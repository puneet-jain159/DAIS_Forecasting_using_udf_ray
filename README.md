This is Repository containing the codes used for the talk ["Hyperparameter Tuning Via Apache Sparkâ„¢ and Ray"](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit/session/hyperparameter-tuning-apache-sparktm-and-ray/)

## Steps to run the forecasting solution
### Step 1. Use init script to start a ray cluster
